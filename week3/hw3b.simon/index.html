Course: ICS 385 Spring 2026
Assignment: Week 3b - Extension of Simon Code
Added levels: Practice, Normal, and Master modes were added to the Simon game. Instructions were also added to make the game more user-friendly. The UI was redesigned to be more visually appealing and interactive.
Notes: To write this code, I first used Codex on Visual Studio to understand the existing code by asking it to add beginner-friendly guiding comments. I then thought about what I wanted to add to the game 
and considered how I could make the game more user-friendly. I created many fairly lengthy prompts for Codex to describe what I wanted. I won’t include them all in their entirety, but with my prompts, I attempted to guide Codex 
to help me add new features such as clearer instructions, improved user interface elements, “practice” and “master” modes, visual feedback for users, and overall design enhancements. For example, my first prompt 
began with "Updating the Simon Game: IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS: There needs to be clear instructions. There should be a panel or a banner that has clear, simple instructions, and then a clickable element for more 
complex ones. The Simon game should play back the sequence instead of just asking for the most recent tile. As of now, it expects users to remember the tile sequence, but it needs to be so that the tile sequence 
plays and users are only expected to remember the new, last added element...". After I explained the basics, I went into more detail about what I wanted. I wanted to make these changes while keeping the existing 
game logic the same, so I indicated that in my prompts. When each phase of changes was complete, I reviewed the updated game and created a new script to apply whatever additional changes I wanted. Once all my 
desired changes were completed, I asked that beginner-friendly comments be added to the updated code to help me understand the changes. I then reviewed the code and the final game to ensure everything looked good.
