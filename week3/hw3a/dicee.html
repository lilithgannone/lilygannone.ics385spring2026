Assignment: Week 3a - Extension of Dicee Code
Notes: To write this code, I first used Codex in Visual Studio to understand the existing code by asking for comments to be added that would aid a beginner programmer in understanding the code. I then thought about how to add the 
needed extensions and make the game more user-friendly. I utilized Codex to update the existing code. I scripted: “Extend the code to include 3 dice. The winner is the highest number of the three dice - no draws are allowed. For 
example, if a 5, 5, and 3 are rolled, there is no winner. So, if two higher dice have the same number, there is no winner, and there is a Draw. A message must display stating  ‘It is a draw! No winner this round.’ if there is a 
draw. The rules surrounding draws need to be noted on the main page. Make sure the site is user-friendly. It should be easily understandable so that children can understand it and play the game”. After that, I checked the site that 
was created. It was a lot better, but I realized I wanted it to be a bit more complex. I also wanted the instructions to be a bit clearer and visually highlighted. I wrote: “Visually highlight the rules. The section that reads 
“Click 'Roll Dice' to play. The highest number wins. If the highest number appears on more than one die, it is a draw.” should be highlighted with a background. “Click 'Roll Dice' to play” should be larger and in its own section. 
Add an effect that displays when there is a winner. Add hover effects to the dice.” I checked the site and was more satisfied with it. I then reviewed the code. I wanted to add a bit more, so I asked that a shake effect be added 
for dice rolls. The only things left to adjust were the title, as it was too simple, and the instructions to make them a bit clearer. So, I prompted Codex to create a more visually appealing header and add player number assignment 
info in the instructions. I then reviewed the code again. It was much more complex, so I asked Codex to add comments to make the code easily understandable for a beginner coder. I then reviewed the code, and it was much easier to 
understand. I tested the site and game play-- logic is correct.
