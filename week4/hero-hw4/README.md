## Overview
This project is an extension of the Hero Node.js code. The initial Hero code was extended to include five NPM packages that save to five individual txt files. Comments where these additions occurred can be viewed in the 'index.js' file. 'npm install' was used to install the two additional packages that did not exist in the initial code. With the program running, the local js server ('http://127.0.0.1:3000') can be opened to view the outputs.
